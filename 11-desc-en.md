[Visualization of the Twitch streaming consumption in france](https://github.com/ThomasRanvier/twitch_consumption)

This project took place in the data visualization course of the M2IA of the Claude Bernard University, in Lyon 1.

Our project is a visualization of streaming consumption of the 30 streamers considered as the most populars in France. 

This visualization highlights three main types of streamers:
* Ponctual streamers, they stream once or twice per week, ex : [Squeezie](https://www.twitch.tv/squeezielive/)
* Regular streamers, they stream almost everyday, ex : [Locklear](https://www.twitch.tv/locklear/) 
* Web TVs, they can be compared to television channels.
Streamers take turn in several shows on those channels, the stream is almost never interrupted on the whole week, ex : [Solary](https://www.twitch.tv/solary/)

You can access to the visualization of this project [here](https://thomasranvier.github.io/twitch_consumption/).
